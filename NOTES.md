## Notes:

- Testing using ATTD (Cucumber + Gherkin). :( I couldn't add them on time
- Add datalizer to use schemas.
- Use a framework for SQL due to this project uses SQLite
- Use Prepared Statements instead of concatenated values
- Limit the size of the file uploaded
- Queries including "LIKE" clause through the req.query object must accept multiple files (If needed)
- It would be better to use mongo instead of SQLite due the dynamic schema layout of the columns.
- There are more things to improve, but for now I think it's enough.
- I will improve this if it's required.
